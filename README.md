# Create Virtual Machine on Azure Portal

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based simulation of a physical computer. Azure, as a leading cloud provider, enables the creation and management of virtual machines, allowing users to quickly deploy scalable and flexible computing resources.

# Use Cases

When an organization is looking to migrate to the Azure cloud, deploying services on newly created virtual machines is often recommended. While there are various services for automating migration, virtual machines offer a versatile and reliable option for hosting a wide range of applications.

Thanks to Azure's high availability and scalability, virtual machines provide an efficient solution for hosting web applications. This ensures optimized traffic management and load distribution, improving overall application performance.

# Business Logic

Azure's virtual machine services eliminate the need for purchasing and maintaining physical infrastructure for specific or periodic tasks. The "pay-as-you-go" pricing model ensures cost efficiency, allowing businesses to only pay for the resources they consume. This flexibility makes Azure VMs a cost-effective choice for enterprises looking to optimize their IT operations.
